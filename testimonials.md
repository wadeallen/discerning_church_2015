>Our church has used this discernment process to help us work through some conversations that had been ongoing for significant lengths of time without every landing on concrete next steps. The process provided clear steps for our team to work through as we prayed together and had conversation about the direction God was leading. Every time we have used it, we have benefited greatly from the clarity and actionable steps God has led us into.
