I am the pastor of a **150 year old** congregation in Muncie, Indiana.  The church in Muncie has experienced extreme change over the years.

In recent years, the church has entered a season of **discernment**.  What we are discovering is that **discerning** is an ongoing process.

My desire is to share thoughts, video, quotes, and other bits as it relates to our discerning as a congregation.

Hopefully, this will be helpful to other churches who are experiencing the same sort of dynamics.
